⚠️ **Warning, this documentation may be outdated as we're making quick changes to wedefine.**

# wedefine
Urban dictionary clone written using Python and the Flask framework in 30 minutes.
It's very easy to modify, as the python part is less than 50 lines long!

## Setup instructions

1. Unzip the file to where you want to run your instance of wedefine
2. Go to the directory and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Go to the directory and type `python main.py`
4. (Optional but reccomended) Use an nginx reverse proxy for ssl and more.
